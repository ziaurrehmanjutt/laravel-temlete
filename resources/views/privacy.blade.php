                        Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c. 5 ("PIPEDA"). We also comply with the European General Data Protection
                        Regulation ("GDPR").<br />Collection and Use<br />In order to provide our services, we collect the

                    </ul>
                    <p>We use this information in a number of ways. For advertisers, we use it to communicate with you about
                        our products, services, and promotions and to invoice you. For affiliates, we use this information
                        to scrutinise applicants for fraud, communicate with you about our products, services, and
                        promotions, track traffic, and to make payments to you. Under the GDPR, the lawful basis for
                        collecting this information is that it is necessary for the performance of the contracts we have
                        entered into and, for the purposes of scrutinising applicants for fraud, our legitimate interests in
                        preventing fraud. We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties.
                        <br /><br />
                        We also collect Internet Protocol addresses (IPs) and User Agent Data (information about your
                        browser and operating system) from people who click on the advertisements we have placed with our
                        affiliates so we can track unique traffic and to identify fraud. Under the GDPR, the lawful basis
                        for collecting this information is that we have a legitimate commercial interest in determining how
                        many unique users click on our advisements and preventing fraud. No more identifying information is
                        collected about this group and so we cannot associate IPs with an identifiable individual.
                        <br /><br />
                        We share your Personal Information with our business partners, service providers and as required by
                        law.

                        We retain Personal Information about our affiliates indefinitely. We do this so that we can
                        scrutinise prospective affiliates against all our known affiliates for fraud prevention purposes. We
                        retain Personal Information about our advertisers for ten years. We retain IPs for ten years.
                        <br /><br />

                        hosting partners store your Personal Information either in Canada, the European Union or a
                        jurisdiction with adequate protection as determined by the European Commission under the terms of
                        the GDPR.
