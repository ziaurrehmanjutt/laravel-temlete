                    <strong class="d-block py-3">What role does NetwrkQube.com play in online advertising?</strong>
                    <p>Affiliates seek to generate advertising revenue from their websites and mailings lists but often lack
                        in time or size to deal directly with multiple large sponsors. On the flipside, advertisers want
                        traffic to generate sales and leads for their websites without the commitment of dealing with
                        hundreds of individual affiliates. NetwrkQube.com acts as a single point of contact for advertisers
                        and affiliates, acting as a trusted source for both sides. Affiliates benefit from having access to
                        thousands of advertising campaigns and receiving a single aggregated "always on time" commission
                        payment from NetwrkQube. Advertisers benefit by having their CPA campaigns made available to
                        thousands of affiliates without having to recruit or maintain a single one.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">What is CPA Marketing?</strong>
                    <p>CPA stands for Cost Per Action. Unlike other marketing models where an advertiser pays for every user
                        seeing their ad (CPM) or clicking on their ad (CPC), an advertiser under the CPA model pays only
                        when a specific action is taken on their website. The advertiser defines this action in advance and
                        only pays when that action is taken. The advertiser action can be as simple as filling out a form on
                        their website or as complex as a multi-page sign-up ending with a purchase through credit card.
                        Generally speaking, the more involved the action, the higher an affiliate would expect to be paid
                        for generating it.</p>

                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Does NetwrkQube accept international affiliates?</strong>
                    <p>We accept affiliates from the majority of countries globally.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Will I be approved if I don't have a website?</strong>
                    <p>You don't need a website to promote our campaigns, but you will need to outline on our application
                        and to your new affiliate manager exactly how you will be promoting. We allow many traffic sources,
                        but there are some that are not permitted.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">When are affiliates paid?</strong>
                    <p>Affiliates are initially paid on a monthly net 15 basis. For example, affiliates generating revenue
                        in January will receive their payments on February 15th. Once an affiliate has received their first
                        payment from us, they are automatically placed on a weekly payment schedule if they are receiving
                        their payments electronically. We require a minimum balance of $100 before we issue a payment. If
                        you don't reach this level, your earnings will roll over to the subsequent pay period until you
                        reach the minimum $100.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">What about weekly payments?</strong>
                    <p>Affiliates who have earned at least one payment from us and who are paid electronically are
                        automatically moved to weekly payments.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">What about weekly payments?</strong>
                    <p>Affiliates who have earned at least one payment from us and who are paid electronically are
                        automatically moved to weekly payments.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">How are affiliates paid?</strong>
                    <p>We pay affiliates via Payoneer and Tipalti payment platforms and within each they offer a range of
                        specific payment options like Check, Intercash, eCheck, ACH, PayPal and Wire. Options available
                        depend on an affiliate's home country.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">What is incentive traffic and is it allowed?</strong>
                    <p>Incentive traffic is when an affiliate offers a user a reward of some kind (virtual or real) to sign
                        up to an advertiser through their affiliate link. A potential affiliate must understand that while
                        NetwrkQube does allow some forms of incentive traffic, affiliates using incentive traffic will be
                        limited to advertising only the few ad campaigns which accept it. Most campaigns do not accept
                        incentive traffic. We're very selective on the kinds of incentive traffic we accept and very strict
                        on incentive affiliate adherence to only advertising the campaigns which allow it.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Does NetwrkQube accept content unlock traffic?</strong>
                    <p>es, we generally accept this kind of traffic but only on campaigns which accept incentive traffic.
                        You are required to own or have the right to distribute the content which is being unlocked. It
                        should be not be pornographic in nature and is subject to the same terms and conditions an
                        affiliate's website is subject to.</p>
                    <br /><br />
                    <h2 class="h2 fw-700">Active Affiliate</h2>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">What's EPC?</strong>
                    <p>EPC stands for Earnings Per Click and is displayed on all Netwrk campaigns. It's a computed average
                        income affiliates are earnings on a given campaign calculated on a per-click basis. This number
                        isn't a guarantee of how much an affiliate will earn by advertising a campaign but is simply a tool
                        for affiliates to gauge their potential interest in advertising a campaign and measuring their
                        conversion compared to the average across the Netwrk.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Does NetwrkQube have an affiliate referral program?</strong>
                    <p>Yes. Affiliates can refer other affiliates and receive a 5% bounty on their earnings for the first 12
                        months of their activity with the Netwrk. The potential referred affiliate must be new to NetwrkQube
                        and not be another advertising Netwrk.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">What can I do if I lose my password?</strong>
                    <p>Visit this page to reclaim a <a href="forgot-password">lost password</a>.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">I want to run a campaign which says 'incentive', but I don't have an
                        incentive website. Can I still advertise it?</strong>
                    <p>A campaign indicating it accepts incentives will also accept non-incentive traffic, so you would be
                        fine to advertise it. We're simply trying to display which campaigns are OK for incentive affiliates
                        to advertise. If there are two versions of a campaign, a non-incentive affiliate would be best to
                        advertise the version which doesn't specify incentive traffic allowed.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Are leads/sales tracked in real time or delayed?</strong>
                    <p>In most cases, leads and sales are tracked in real time, but there can be up to a 5-minute delay for
                        our server to refresh affiliate statistics. There are some advertising campaigns where a sale/lead
                        is only declared days after the user signed up. In such circumstances, this will be disclosed in the
                        ad campaign description.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Can I sign up to campaigns myself or get my friends to sign up?</strong>
                    <p>No, it's against the <a href="terms">terms and conditions</a> which govern an affiliate account
                        for an affiliate to generate his own leads or get his friends to sign up for him.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Why is it I'm not seeing any leads/sales generated on a campaign when I
                        know leads/sales must have been generated?</strong>
                    <p>There are a number of reasons why this could happen. These include, but are not limited to users
                        visiting a campaign page through another affiliate link, users entering invalid data, users not
                        fully completing the signup, user data not matching campaign demographic requirements, and surfers
                        having cookies disabled on their computer. Generally speaking, most cases of untracked test or
                        friend-generated leads are explained by an affiliate simply unfamiliar with all the details an
                        advertiser requires to validate a lead as real.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Can I use Google/Facebook/YouTube/etc. as a traffic source?</strong>
                    <p>Affiliates can purchase approved ad placements from third party traffic sources. Each campaign on
                        NetwrkQube has specific rules as to whether a given traffic source is allowed or not. For example,
                        it's not uncommon for some advertisers to request they not receive social Netwrk traffic, to which
                        affiliates must comply. Affiliates are responsible for the nature and quality of the advertising
                        they bring into the Netwrk from third parties. Affiliates must ensure they are following the terms
                        of service and advertising guidelines of the websites from where they are acquiring traffic.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Why do my paid clicks stats from Google/Bing/Facebook/etc. not match the
                        number of clicks showing in NetwrkQube?</strong>
                    <p>Click tracking between two sources never matches 100%. Some of the clicks an affiliate purchases from
                        a third party might get IP filtered because they are from a country the campaign doesn't accept.
                        Even if you're buying specific country-targeted traffic to send to a campaign accepting traffic from
                        that same country, rarely does the logic behind two IP filters match 100%. It could also be that the
                        surfer abandons the browser before a click is tracked on both sides. A small discrepancy in click
                        stats is expected and normal.</p>
                    <br /><br />
                    <h2 class="h2 fw-700">Affiliate Termination and Problem</h2>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">I'm not using my affiliate account. Can I sell or transfer it?</strong>
                    <p>No, you may not. It is grounds for account termination or worse. Only people interested in acquiring
                        dormant affiliate accounts do so with the intent of defrauding advertisers. If an affiliate sells
                        their account, they're likely assisting someone in committing a crime and are subject to potential
                        litigation. NetwrkQube fully supports advertisers and law enforcement agencies in their attempts to
                        prosecute fraud. If you don't want your affiliate account anymore, simply tell your affiliate
                        manager and we'll close it for you.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Can I do a joint venture (JV) where I allow someone else access to my
                        account for a share of the profits they generate?</strong>
                    <p>No, this is directly against NetwrkQube's affiliate <a href="terms">terms and conditions</a>.
                        Just like selling your affiliate account, the bulk of those interested in joint ventures do so with
                        intent of defrauding advertisers. An affiliate is solely responsible for the leads generated on a
                        campaign. Should the second party in the joint venture generate fraudulent leads/sales, it's the
                        affiliate who risks account termination and litigation, not the second party.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">My affiliate account was terminated but I want to plead my case. What
                        should I do?</strong>
                    <p>In most cases, by the time you've received the termination email, it's too late. Our compliance
                        department monitors traffic/leads constantly and action is swift when a problem is found. Affiliates
                        are generally told when a minor problem is found and given the opportunity to make corrections.
                        Major problems usually result in immediate account termination. If you want to plead your case, send
                        a reply to the compliance email you received. Your best bet is to admit wrongdoing, accept the
                        reversal of your leads/sales and ask permission to try again. In the rare circumstance that an
                        affiliate is wrongly terminated from the Netwrk, they should reply to the compliance email and
                        politely describe the problem and why they feel they are innocent.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">My account was terminated but only a portion of my leads were fraudulently
                        generated. Will I get paid?</strong>
                    <p>Partial fraud doesn't equate to partial payment. No payment will be issued to a terminated account.
                    </p>
                    <br /><br />
                    <h2 class="h2 fw-700">Advertiser</h2>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Who will run my campaign, where will the traffic come from?</strong>
                    <p>NetwrkQube has over 25,000 affiliates from across the globe in the Netwrk. Affiliates are able to
                        choose campaigns that they are interested in promoting based on the fit with their audience or
                        traffic type. NetwrkQube Affiliate Managers will guide affiliates towards campaigns that would be
                        suitable for them to promote.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">What if I don't want certain traffic types used to promote my
                        campaign?</strong>
                    <p>Advertisers can however specify in advance whether they want to exclude certain types of traffic for
                        their campaign. For example: 'No paid search engine traffic', or 'No social media traffic'.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">Do I get contact with the affiliates running my ads?</strong>
                    <p>There is no direct contact between affiliates and advertisers. All interaction goes through the
                        Netwrk, as you will have a dedicated Account Manager as your day-to-day point of contact. Affiliates
                        come to NetwrkQube specifically for the benefit of having a single contact point for multiple
                        promotional opportunities.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">How does tracking work?</strong>
                    <p>NetwrkQube uses postbacks to track actions. We provide the advertiser with a postback URL to place in
                        their tracking platform, or directly to their website's backend. When the user clicks through and
                        completes the action, the postback calls back to our server to declare the action is valid. The
                        server call credits the correct affiliate and correct campaign for the action generated.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">How much volume can you do on my campaign?</strong>
                    <p>NetwrkQube can't predict exact traffic volumes on potential campaigns. There are many factors that
                        must be considered - much depends on the conversion of the campaign, the target countries and
                        demographics, the decided upon payout versus competitive campaigns, and the mix of affiliates who
                        are actively promoting the campaign. Some campaigns can see hundreds of thousands of clicks and
                        leads, while others might be promoted on a smaller scale.</p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">What can we do to ensure we get quality leads?</strong>
                    <p>NetwrkQube puts potential affiliates through an identity screening, and quality assurance and fraud
                        checks before we allow them into the Netwrk. The internal Compliance Team also monitors traffic
                        daily for spikes and trends in lead activity. This helps reduce the occurrence of fraud and bad
                        leads.
                        <br /><br />
                        However, Advertisers must also work at monitoring data and reporting problems as needed. NetwrkQube
                        does not have insight into the lead form data captured by the advertiser, or how conversions are
                        monetizing for the advertiser. Advertisers are passed the IDs of the affiliates generating traffic
                        for their campaign. Advertisers should use this ID with their internal quality checks and reporting
                        to analyze the profitability of the traffic they are receiving on an individual affiliate ID level.
                        NetwrkQube can help optimize the campaign with the Advertiser, provided there is the timely and
                        accurate sharing of feedback.
                    </p>
                    <strong class="d-block py-3">How do I find out if NetwrkQube will take me on as an advertiser?</strong>
                    <p>Send us some details about the campaign you'd like to bring to NetwrkQube through the contact us
                        page. Please include as much information as possible about your campaign including sample landing
                        pages, rates or payouts, target countries and budgetary caps. We receive many requests so please do
